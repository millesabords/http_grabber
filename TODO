 Using the dashboard scripts

The dashboard branch contains a dashboard client helper script. Use these commands to track it:

    $ mkdir -p ~/Dashboards/CMakeScripts 
    $ cd ~/Dashboards/CMakeScripts 
    $ git init 
    $ git remote add -t dashboard origin git://cmake.org/cmake.git 
    $ git pull origin 

The cmake_common.cmake script contains setup instructions in its top comments. Update the dashboard branch to get the latest version of this script by simply running

    $ git pull origin
